## 🌟 Features

- **Animal Management**: Purchase and care for individual pets (dogs, cats, horses) and livestock (cows, pigs, chickens, sheep)
- **Dynamic Health System**: Animal health decays realistically over time based on care actions
- **Market Value Evolution**: Animals gain value over time when properly cared for
- **Inventory Management**: Purchase and use supplies like food, water, medicine, and treats
- **Farmer's Market**: Buy and sell animals and supplies
- **Transaction History**: Track all purchases, sales, and care actions

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19** with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router 7** for navigation with hash routing for static hosting compatibility
- **Context API** for state management (AuthContext, RefreshContext)
- **Axios** for API communication with interceptors for token refresh
- **JWT-decode** for token handling
- **CSS** with component-scoped styling and responsive design

### Backend

- **Node.js** with Express for RESTful API
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM for data persistence
- **JWT Authentication** with refresh token rotation
- **Bcrypt** for secure password hashing
- **Helmet** for enhanced HTTP security headers
- **Express Rate Limit** for API abuse prevention
- **Cookie-parser** for HTTP-only cookie management
- **CORS** for cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **Morgan** for HTTP request logging

### Mobile (Planned)

- **Capacitor** for cross-platform mobile app deployment
- Native device features integration
- Push notifications for animal care reminders
- Offline capabilities

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication System

- **JWT-based authentication** with short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
- **Refresh token rotation** with longer-lived tokens (3 days)
- **HTTP-only cookies** for secure token storage
- **Password hashing** with bcrypt and appropriate salt rounds
- **Case-insensitive email** handling for consistent user experience

### API Protection

- **Protected routes** with JWT verification middleware
- **Resource ownership verification** for all data access
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse (configurable per endpoint)
- **Helmet integration** for security headers
- **Input validation** on both client and server
- **Centralized error handling** with appropriate error responses

### Token Management

- **In-memory access token** storage (not in localStorage)
- **HTTP-only cookie** for refresh token
- **Automatic token refresh** on 401 responses
- **Request queue system** during token refresh
