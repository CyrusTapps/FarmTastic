   - Enhance visual health indicators
   - Implement farm statistics section
   - Add quick action buttons for common tasks

5. User Profile:
   - Create user profile page
   - Allow farm name editing
   - Show transaction history
   - Add user settings (if needed)

## Important Decisions Made

1. Frontend:

   - Using individual CSS files per component
   - No additional styling libraries (handling custom CSS)
   - Router setup in App.jsx
   - Planning for future mobile with Capacitor
   - SplashScreen implemented as a standalone component with timer
   - AuthContext for centralized authentication state management
   - Switched to hash routing for better compatibility with AWS S3 static hosting
   - Enhanced index.html with SEO meta tags
   - Created reusable components for assets (AssetCard, AssetList)
   - Implemented responsive grid layout for dashboard
   - Added pet naming modal for better user experience
   - Implemented category-based animal handling (pet vs. livestock)
   - Created RefreshContext for optimized data refreshing
   - Implemented consistent pattern for inventory management across all animal care actions
   - Created TransactionList component with filtering capabilities
   - Added proper transaction type labeling and formatting

2. Backend:
   - Robust security setup (bcrypt, helmet, etc.)
   - JWT stored in cookies
   - Local MongoDB first, then Atlas
   - Express server with Vercel deployment planned
   - Email case-insensitivity for login (normalized to lowercase)
   - Increased rate limits for development (to be reduced before production)
   - Extended JWT expiration times for better user experience (1h for access token, 3d for refresh token)
   - Implemented proper animal categorization (pet vs. livestock)
   - Created transaction model for purchase history
   - Standardized API response format for consistent client-side handling
   - Implemented proper inventory management with quantity tracking and deletion when depleted
   - Added comprehensive transaction tracking for all financial activities
