# Security Implementation

## Authentication System

### JWT Implementation

- Access tokens (short-lived: 1 hour)
- Refresh tokens (longer-lived: 3 days)
- Token refresh mechanism
- Token storage in HTTP-only cookies

### Password Security

- Bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds
- No plain text password storage
- Password validation rules enforced

### User Identity

- Email addresses normalized to lowercase
- Case-insensitive login
- Username uniqueness enforced

## Route Protection

### Backend Protection

- Auth middleware checks JWT validity
- Owner verification for all resources
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Frontend Protection

- ProtectedRoute component redirects unauthenticated users
- AuthContext manages authentication state
- Token refresh handled automatically

## API Security

### Request/Response Security

- CORS configuration with specific origins
- Helmet for security headers
- Input validation and sanitization

### Error Handling

- Generic error messages in production
- Detailed errors only in development
- Centralized error handling

## Token Management

### Token Storage

- Access token: Memory only (not in localStorage)
- Refresh token: HTTP-only cookie
- Token refresh mechanism for seamless experience

### Token Refresh Strategy

- Automatic refresh on 401 responses
- Queue system for concurrent requests during refresh
- Fallback to login on refresh failure

## Rate Limiting

- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Higher limits in development
- Reduced limits planned for production

## Mobile Security Considerations

### Android-Specific Security

- HTTP traffic allowed only in development
- HTTPS required for production
- Network security configuration for Android 9+
- Proper permissions in AndroidManifest.xml

### Token Storage in Mobile

- Secure storage for tokens in mobile environment
- Consideration for biometric authentication in future versions
- Session management adapted for mobile context

## Technical Requirements Tracking

1. Authentication:

   - [x] Protected routes (frontend)
   - [x] Login/Register flows (frontend)
   - [x] Cookie handling
   - [x] Email case-insensitivity
   - [x] Token refresh mechanism

2. Security:
   - [x] Password hashing
   - [x] Route protection (backend)
   - [x] Server health checks
   - [x] Input validation (frontend)
   - [x] Rate limiting (configured for development)
   - [x] Token refresh mechanism

## Pre-Deployment Security Adjustments

1. **JWT Secret**:

   - File: `server/.env`
   - Change: Update JWT_SECRET to a strong, unique value
   - Current code: `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
   - Target code: `JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-string>`

2. **Cookie Security**:

   - File: `server/controllers/authController.js`
   - Change: Ensure secure flag is enabled for production
   - Current code: `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"`
   - Verify NODE_ENV is set to "production" in deployment environment

3. **Error Handling**:

   - File: `server/server.js`
   - Change: Ensure detailed errors are not exposed in production
   - Current code: `error: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "Server Error" : err.message`
   - Verify NODE_ENV is set to "production" in deployment environment

4. **API Base URL**:

   - File: `src/services/api.js`
   - Change: Update API base URL to production endpoint
   - Current code: `baseURL: "http://localhost:5000/api"`
   - Target code: `baseURL: "https://your-production-api.com/api"`

5. **Console Logging**:

   - Files: Multiple (search for "console.log")
   - Change: Remove or disable excessive console logging in production build
   - Consider implementing a logging utility that only logs in development

6. **Mobile Configuration**:
   - File: `capacitor.config.json`
   - Change: Update androidScheme to "https" for production
   - Current code: `"androidScheme": "http"` (development)
   - Target code: `"androidScheme": "https"` (production)
