# Session Notes: YYYY-MM-DD

## Focus Areas

- Implemented transaction history system with filtering
- Fixed inventory management issues, particularly with water items
- Enhanced animal detail page functionality
- Improved API communication between client and server

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Transaction History System

We successfully implemented a comprehensive transaction history system:

- Created TransactionList component to display transaction history
- Added filtering by transaction type (purchases, sales, animals, inventory)
- Fixed styling issues to ensure proper text visibility
- Implemented proper date formatting and transaction type labeling
- Added conditional styling based on transaction type (positive/negative)

### 2. Fixed Water Inventory Management

We identified and fixed an issue where water inventory items weren't being properly deleted from the database when their quantity reached zero. The problem was in how the client was communicating with the server:

- Updated `waterAnimal` function in `animalService.js` to properly pass data to the server
- Modified server-side controller to handle water inventory consistently with other inventory types
- Added proper error handling and response processing

### 3. Enhanced Animal Detail Page

Added comprehensive animal care functionality:

- Implemented giving treats, vitamins, and medicine to animals
- Added proper inventory selection for feeding and medicine
- Ensured all animal care actions properly update inventory
- Added visual feedback for animal care actions

### 4. API Optimization

- Fixed inconsistencies in API service functions
- Ensured proper data passing between client and server
- Added better error handling for failed API calls
- Improved response handling for inventory updates

## Technical Challenges Overcome

### Transaction Display Issues

The main challenge was ensuring proper display of transaction data:

1. Initially, only transaction amounts were visible due to text color issues (white text on white background)
2. Fixed by updating CSS to ensure proper contrast for all text elements
3. Added proper mapping of transaction types to user-friendly labels
4. Implemented conditional styling based on transaction type

### Inventory Deletion Issue

The main challenge was identifying why water inventory wasn't being properly deleted. We found that:

1. The client wasn't sending the water item ID to the server
2. The server wasn't properly handling the case when water quantity reached zero
3. The response wasn't correctly indicating to the client that the item was deleted

We fixed this by ensuring consistent patterns across all inventory-related functions.

## Next Steps

- Add pagination for transaction history
- Implement date range filtering for transactions
- Add confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions
- Improve health calculation display
- Add history of care actions
- Enhance visual feedback for animal care actions
- Create inventory detail view
- Implement inventory usage tracking
