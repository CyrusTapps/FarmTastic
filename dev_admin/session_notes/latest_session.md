# Session Notes: [Current Date]

## Current Project Status

### What's Working

- Authentication system (login, register, token refresh)
- Dashboard with animal and inventory display
- Market page with purchasing functionality
- Animal detail page with care actions
- Data refresh strategy with 5-minute polling
- Inventory management for animal care items (food, water, medicine, treats, vitamins)
- Transaction history with filtering capabilities

### Recent Fixes

- Fixed API request frequency issues by implementing RefreshContext
- Optimized token refresh mechanism to prevent loops
- Added proper cleanup for components making API calls
- Implemented conditional console logging
- Fixed water inventory management issue to properly update database when used
- Fixed transaction display and filtering issues

## Today's Accomplishments

1. **Implemented Transaction History System**

   - Created TransactionList component to display transaction history
   - Added filtering capabilities by transaction type (purchases, sales, animals, inventory)
   - Fixed styling issues to ensure proper text visibility
   - Implemented proper date formatting for transaction timestamps
   - Added transaction type labeling for better readability

2. **Fixed Inventory Management Issues**

   - Resolved issue with water inventory not being properly deleted when quantity reaches zero
   - Ensured consistent behavior across all inventory types (food, water, medicine, treats, vitamins)
   - Added proper error handling for inventory-related actions
   - Improved client-server communication for inventory updates

3. **Enhanced Animal Detail Page**

   - Added functionality for giving treats, vitamins, and medicine to animals
   - Implemented proper inventory selection for feeding and medicine
   - Ensured all animal care actions properly update inventory
   - Added visual feedback for animal care actions

4. **API Optimization**
   - Fixed inconsistencies in API service functions
   - Ensured proper data passing between client and server
   - Added better error handling for failed API calls
   - Improved response handling for inventory updates

## Technical Details

### Transaction System Implementation

The transaction system now properly displays all transaction types with appropriate styling:

```javascript
// Key improvements in TransactionList component
const getTransactionTypeLabel = (type) => {
  if (!type) return "Unknown";

  const typeMap = {
    buy: "Purchase",
    sell: "Sale",
    vet: "Vet Visit",
    use: "Used Item",
  };
  return typeMap[type] || type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + type.slice(1);
};

// Determine if a transaction affects balance positively or negatively
const isNegativeTransaction = (type) => {
  return type === "buy" || type === "vet";
};
```

We also fixed the filter mapping in the Transactions page:

```javascript
// Map the UI filter values to the API filter values
const getApiFilter = (uiFilter) => {
  switch (uiFilter) {
    case "purchase":
      return "buy";
    case "sale":
      return "sell";
    case "animal":
      return "animal";
    case "inventory":
      return "inventory";
    default:
      return "all";
  }
};
```

### Fixed Water Inventory Issue

The key issue was in the `waterAnimal` function in `animalService.js`, which wasn't properly passing data to the server:

```javascript
// Before:
export const waterAnimal = async (id) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post(`/animals/${id}/water`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error watering animal ${id}:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// After:
export const waterAnimal = async (id, data = {}) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post(`/animals/${id}/water`, data);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error watering animal ${id}:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Next Steps (For Next Session)

### 1. Transaction System Enhancement

- Add pagination for transaction history
- Implement date range filtering
- Add transaction details view
- Create transaction summary statistics

### 2. Animal Detail Page Further Enhancement

- Add confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions (selling)
- Improve health calculation display
- Add history of care actions
- Enhance visual feedback for animal care actions

### 3. Inventory Management

- Create inventory detail view (if needed)
- Implement inventory usage tracking
- Add inventory sorting/filtering
- Enhance inventory card display with more details

### 4. Dashboard Improvements

- Add sorting and filtering options for animals and inventory
- Enhance visual health indicators
- Implement farm statistics section
- Add quick action buttons for common tasks

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Token Refresh Edge Cases**

   - Need to handle cases where refresh token is invalid
   - Improve error messaging for authentication failures

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**

   - Some components need better mobile layouts
   - Test on various device sizes

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimize image loading

4. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages for user actions
   - Add better fallbacks for failed API calls

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we implement WebSockets for real-time updates instead of polling?
2. Do we need a more sophisticated caching strategy as data volume increases?
3. Should we add user roles/permissions for future admin features?
4. What analytics should we track for user engagement?

## Resources Needed for Next Session

- Animal health calculation algorithm details
- UI mockups for enhanced animal detail page
- List of inventory types and their effects on animals
- Transaction history display requirements
